My goal was to implement “/proc/helper” command using “proc” filesystem that presents internal system information.

Implementation will show us:

1)Each CPU usage

2)Memory usage info

3)Hard disk usage info

4)Time the system has been active

5)List of users in the system

I was able to implement everything except Hard disk usage info unfortunately.
